My name is **Jack Ye**, and this is my personal blog.  

I am an M.S. candidate in *Computer Science* at the [Department of Computer Science & Engineering](http://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/) at **Texas A&M University**. My undergraduate degree is obtained in **Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications** where I majored in *Networking Engineering* at [School of Computer Science](http://scs.bupt.edu.cn/cs_web/).

At some point in the not-terribly-distant future, I hope to found a self-sustaining collective of clever people, for fun, profit(?), and the promotion of human life in the universe.

Anyways, for now I'm just working to seek a job in North America. My ultra dream is to apply Mathematics to computer to create an unprecedented, profound, aesthetic piece of work, such as a novel algorithm, or an app. Not that I necessarily expect to succeed, but it's something to strive for, and it's a fun problem to work on.



I make stuff.


*Beautiful, practical, meaningful stuff.*


I make what I love.

*I love what I do.*
